# Git Rules

## Commit Messages

- Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By" lines to commit messages
- Follow Conventional Commits format
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood in subject line

## Commit Best Practices

- Commit by semantic or functional unit
- Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit
- Write meaningful commit messages explaining "why"
- When modifying interfaces (function signatures, class APIs), update docstrings in the same commit
